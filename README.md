# gankbotV2
## GankBot ported to C#

GankBot is a simple Discord Bot which listens for command inputs and provides responses. I've commented most code but avoided repeating myself. In the modules folder for example the top files are well commented whereas the ones at the bottom have no comments.

GankBot uses [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) wrapper to function.
